## FAQ for DemoLoop:

### Q: I don't see a Video. A: You might own an Intel Mac, or you have moved the com.apple.ist.DemoLoop folder to the wrong place. If errors further Presist open an issue.
### Q: I have an M2 MacBook Air. When is Demoloop coming or how can I run the other demoloops? Just rename the one you'd like to "M2_Air"
### Q: Can I get the one that says: Mac Does That, super long battery life etc. A: Yes, you can. It's available in more languages too! It's available in: Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Roman, Vietnamese, and English. To install these, follow these instructions: Go to the preferred Language folder inside com.apple.ist.DemoLoop: Czech = CZE, Hungarian = HUN, Polish = POL, Roman = ROU, Vietnamese = VNM, and English= WW. For example, go to the WW folder, and there, choose any of the qualities, I chose 2560x1664 for best quality on my Display, though if you have a bigger monitor choose the highest quality. Rename the .mov file to your corresponding Mac model so If you have an M1 Macbook air then rename it to: 'M1_Air.mov'. Then copy that video, back out from the whatever language folder you opened, then, paste it into somewhere else THEN the com.apple.ist.demoloop folder. Now, copy the existing corresponding video you have and paste it into somewhere safe. Now move the language corresponding one into "com.apple.ist.DemoLoop" and now, Run DemoLoop and it should work.
